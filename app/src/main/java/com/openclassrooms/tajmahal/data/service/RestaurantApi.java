/**
 * Interface for fetching restaurant data.
 * <p>
 * Represents the API for accessing restaurant information. In a real-world application,
 * this interface might be implemented using a library like Retrofit, and would include annotations
 * specifying the HTTP methods (like GET, POST), the endpoint URL, and other API-specific details.
 * </p>
 *
 * For beginners: An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class or you can say it is a collection of
 * abstract methods and static constants. In an interface, each method is public and abstract but it does
 * not contain any constructor. An interface is not a class. Writing an interface is similar to writing a class,
 * but they are two different concepts. A class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object.
 * An interface contains behaviors that a class implements.
 *
 * <p>
 * Here, {@link RestaurantApi} provides a method to get details of a restaurant.
 * </p>
